  >> If you see a warning message: "The key is not known by any other names. Are you sure you want to continue connecting?", type "yes" and press Enter.
  >> You will see a message confirming the successful connection to GitHub.
  >> If the system asks you for a passphrase, enter the passphrase you set during key generation.
