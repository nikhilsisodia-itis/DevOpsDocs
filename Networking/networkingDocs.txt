> The OSI Model:
  >> OSI stands for Open Systems Interconnection.
  >> A reference model.
  >> Divides the network communication into 7 layers.

      >> Provides the interface between the application and the network.
      >> HTTP, FTP.
  
  >> Presentation layer:
      >> Converts the data into a format that can be understood by the application.
      >> Encryption, Decryption. 

  >> Session layer:
      >> Establishes, maintains, and terminates the connection between the devices.
      >> NetBIOS.
      >> Session layer data is divided into packets or segments.
      >> Segments consists of the data, source port, destination port, and sequence number.

  >> Transport layer:

      >> Consist of HTTP, FTP, SMTP, POP3, IMAP.
      >> DNS is also a part of the application layer.
  >> Transport layer:

      >> Consist of TCP, UDP.
      >> TCP is connection-oriented.
      >> UDP is connectionless.
  >> Network layer:
      >> Routes the data packets between the devices.
