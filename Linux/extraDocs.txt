Q.1- Why an ICMP is sent successfully to 127.0.0.1 using ping -c 1 127.0.0.1, even when I don't have an active internet connection?
Ans.- The IP address 127.0.0.1 is the loopback address, which is used to test network software without physically transmitting packets over a network. When you ping 127.0.0.1, the ICMP packet is sent to your own machine, not over the internet. This allows you to test your network stack and software locally, even without an active internet connection.

Q.2- What is a command, options in commands and arguments in commands?
Ans.-   > Command- A command is an instruction given to a computer program to perform a specific task or function.
        > Options- Modifiers that change the behavior of the command. They usually start with a dash (-) or double dash (--).
        > Arguments- The targets or inputs for the command, such as files, directories, or other data.
        > For example, in the command ping -c 1 8.8.8.8:
            Command: ping
            Option: -c 1 (where -c specifies the count and 1 is the value).
            Argument: 8.8.8.8 (the IP address to ping).

Q.3- Can the timeout of the sudo command be increased?
Ans.- > Yes, the timeout of the sudo command can be increased by modifying the sudoers file. You can use the visudo command to edit the sudoers file and change the default timeout value. However, it is important to be cautious when modifying the sudoers file, as incorrect changes can lead to security vulnerabilities.
      > Process to change: 
        > Open a terminal and run the command sudo visudo.
        > Find the line that starts with Defaults env_reset and add the following line below it:
            > Defaults timestamp_timeout=<new_timeout_value>

Q.4- What's the difference between /bin and /sbin?
Ans.- > /bin: Contains essential user commands and binaries that are available to all users. 
              It consist of executable programs like- cd, ls, cat, rm, etc.
              Helps in effecitve functioning of the system.
        /sbin: Consist of essential commands and binaries that are only available to the root user.
               A container for executable programs like- fdisk, mkfs, etc.
               Supports effecitve system administration.
