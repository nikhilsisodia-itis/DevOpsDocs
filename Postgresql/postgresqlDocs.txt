    >> Create a Database: CREATE DATABASE database_name;
    >> Connect to a Database: \c database_name;
    >> List Databases: \l;
    >> Drop a Database: DROP DATABASE database_name;

  > Listing down the existing database:
    >> Execute the following Query using the Query tool in PgAdmin OR from the psql shell: 
      >>> SELECT datname FROM pg_database;
      >>> datname is the column name that contains the database names.
      >>> pg_database is the system catalog table that contains the database information.

    OR

    >> Run the following command from the psql shell:
      >>> \l
      >>> The \l command is used to list down the existing databases.
  
  *NOTE*: Uppercase and lowercase can be used for queries in PostgreSQL.
  *NOTE*: Semicolon is used to terminate the query in PostgreSQL.
  *NOTE*: The backslash (\) is used to execute the psql shell commands.
  *NOTE*: The psql shell commands are case-insensitive.
  *NOTE*: Uppercase is preferred & used for more readability.
